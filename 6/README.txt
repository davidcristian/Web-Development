PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY.

Write a web page that contains a form with at least 5 input fields
and a button. Whenever the user clicks on that button, a modal interface
window (actually a div) pops up in the middle of the browser window.
This modal window contains 4 input fields and a button.
If the user clicks on that button, the modal window
closes and all the values inserted by the user in the modal
window's input fields are concatenated and added to a text
field in the main form. During the time the modal window is
displayed, the fields from the main form are inactive and
a transparrent gray div is displayed on top of the web
page (this grey div is beneath the modal window and should
occupy the whole browser window).
