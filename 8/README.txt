Develop an Angular UI (user interface) for the PHP task task you have solved
for task 7. In other words, the exercise you need to solve for this task will
be the same exercise you had for task 7 (PHP, Ajax, JSON). The backend of the
solution will be the same (i.e. the PHP code), but you have to change the
frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to be an Angular application.
